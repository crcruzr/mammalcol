The goal of mammalcol is to allow access to the List of Mammal Species of Colombia

## Installation

You can install the development version of mammalcol from [GitHub](https://github.com/mammalcol) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dlizcano/mammalcol")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to search mammal names in Colombia

```{r example1}
splist <- c("Tapirus bairdii", "Tapirus pinchaque", "Tapirus terrestris",
           "Tapirus terrestris",  "Pudu mephistophiles", "Tapirus bairdii")

search_mammalcol(splist)

```

`mammalcol` has the ability to correct minor typos and lower case in the genus  

```{r cars}
splist <- c("Tapiru terrestre", "pudu mephistophiles", "tapirus bairdii")

search_mammalcol(splist)
```
